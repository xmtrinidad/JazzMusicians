## Uplabs Mockup

The mockup for this project can be found [here](https://www.uplabs.com/posts/impersionism).

My goal is to change to a carousel for mobile layouts.  I'll be using the [ngx-carousel](https://github.com/sheikalthaf/ngx-carousel) for this.

## Goals

* Get more experience using the [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) framework
* Use [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/) as a backend for displaying content
* using [Subjects](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/gettingstarted/subjects.md) for cross component communication

## Docs

Anything new I learn or anything I need to review will be documented below
